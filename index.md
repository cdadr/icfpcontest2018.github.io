and the 72hr full contest will end at

The task description will be published on this website when the contest starts.
Details of the submission procedure will be announced along with the contest

This is an open contest.  Anyone may participate except for the contest

entry fee is required.  Contestants are free to organize themselves into teams
of any size.

Any programming language(s) on any platform(s) may be used.

There will be cash prizes for the first and second place teams, the team winning
the lightning division, and a discretionary judges' prize. The winners will be
announced at [ICFP 2018](https://icfp18.sigplan.org) (St. Louis, Missouri,
United States; Monday 24 -- Wednesday 26 September 2018).

In addition, the organizers will declare during the conference that:
* the first place team's language is "the programming language of choice for discriminating hackers",
* the second place team's language is "a fine tool for many applications",
* the winning lightning division team's language is "very suitable for rapid prototyping", and
* the team winning the judges' prize is "an extremely cool bunch of hackers".

## Contest Organizers
